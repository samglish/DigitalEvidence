## First Responder Procedure in Digital Forensics

### Introduction
The **First Responder** in digital forensics is the first person to arrive at the scene of a cyber incident. Their role is essential in identifying, preserving, and protecting digital evidence before any further analysis. A single mistake at this stage can compromise the entire investigation.

### Obstacles Faced by First Responders
- **Volatility of data**: RAM, open sessions, and temporary files can be lost quickly.
- **Lack of tools or training**: Not all responders are forensic experts.
- **Legal constraints**: Actions may require prior authorization (e.g., search warrant).
- **Time pressure**: Need to act fast while ensuring accuracy.
- **Remote or encrypted environments**: Makes access and acquisition harder.

### Why Is This Role Necessary?
- Digital crime scenes are **time-sensitive**.
- Evidence must be collected in a **legally acceptable** way.
- The First Responder ensures the **chain of custody** is preserved.
- Avoids contamination of data (e.g., by automatic processes, reboot, or user activity).
- Helps identify whether an incident is **internal or external**, malicious or accidental.
