## First Responder Procedure in Digital Forensics

### Introduction

The **First Responder** in digital forensics is the first person to arrive at the scene of a cyber incident. Their role is essential in identifying, preserving, and protecting digital evidence before any further analysis. A single mistake at this stage can compromise the entire investigation.

### Obstacles Faced by First Responders

- **Volatility of data**: RAM, open sessions, and temporary files can be lost quickly.
- **Lack of tools or training**: Not all responders are forensic experts.
- **Legal constraints**: Actions may require prior authorization (e.g., search warrant).
- **Time pressure**: Need to act fast while ensuring accuracy.
- **Remote or encrypted environments**: Makes access and acquisition harder.

---

### Why Is This Role Necessary?

- Digital crime scenes are **time-sensitive**.
- Evidence must be collected in a **legally acceptable** way.
- The First Responder ensures the **chain of custody** is preserved.
- Avoids contamination of data (e.g., by automatic processes, reboot, or user activity).
- Helps identify whether an incident is **internal or external**, malicious or accidental.

### Key Characteristics of a Good First Responder

- **Trained in handling digital evidence**
- **Aware of legal and ethical limits**
- **Calm and methodical under pressure**
- **Able to document every step** with timestamps
- Uses **forensic-safe tools** (write blockers, imaging tools)

### Anti-Digital Forensics (ADF) Approaches
**Anti-Digital Forensics** refers to techniques used to:
- **Destroy, hide, or manipulate** digital evidence
- **Erase traces** of illegal activity
- **Delay or mislead** investigators

Common ADF techniques:
- **Data wiping tools** (e.g., `shred`, `dd`, `BleachBit`)
- **Rootkits and steganography**
- **Timestamp alteration**
- **File obfuscation and encryption**
- **Log cleaning and spoofing**

### Use of `shred` on Linux (ADF Example)

`shred` is a command-line tool in Linux used to **securely erase files** by overwriting them multiple times.

#### Syntax:

```bash
shred -n 3 -z -u filename
```
